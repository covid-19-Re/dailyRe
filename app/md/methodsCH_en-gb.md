<h4>Methods</h4>

The reported R<sub>e</sub> for a given day is the mean R<sub>e</sub> over the last 3 days. We report the estimated median with the 95% uncertainty interval. The method to estimate R<sub>e</sub> is described [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71345). 
We further provide a 7-day estimate. This estimate is obtained by assuming a constant R<sub>e</sub> over the last seven days. The results of such a piecewise constant procedure can be viewed visually using the option "Step-wise constant".

The method to estimate R<sub>e</sub> is described [here](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.71345). Since June 2022, we first smooth the data with a LOESS step, and then estimate the infection dates using a [deconvolution](https://www.pnas.org/content/106/51/21825) step (discussed [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20307) and [here](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/comments?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008409)). Then, we estimate R<sub>e</sub> using the [EpiEstim](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html) software from the estimated infection dates. Results using the method for data until April 2020 can be accessed [here](https://smw.ch/article/doi/smw.2020.20271).

Since June 2020, all estimates of R<sub>e</sub> for Switzerland are based on data from the FOPH. On weekdays, the FOPH communicates the number of newly confirmed cases that they received over the last 24 hours. These cases typically stem from the last three days. To estimate R<sub>e</sub> we therefore analyze the number of newly confirmed cases from each particular day ignoring the past two days. As a result, the numbers in our dashboard are different from the numbers given in the daily FOPH situation reports.

<h4>Caveats</h4>

In general, we note that the R<sub>e</sub> estimates for the last days may still be consolidated during subsequent days. This consolidation in particular occurs for small regions, during changes in the dynamics, and in case of small case numbers. We thus base our interpretation on estimated trends over several days. In particular, we further provide a 7-day estimate.

In times of high test positivity rate and delayed hospital reports during the second wave, estimates based on the case numbers and hospitalizations may be too low. The R<sub>e</sub> based on positivity (confirmed cases/tests) is reliable if the persons tested are a random cross section of the population; since we test specifically symptomatic persons, this R<sub>e</sub> value may also be biased. R<sub>e</sub> estimates based on waste water samples are independent of testing regimes (but have other caveats such as that changing precipitation can add noise to the measurements), we provide these estimates for Switzerland [here](https://ibz-shiny.ethz.ch/wastewaterRe/). We recommend viewing the different R<sub>e</sub> estimates when assessing the epidemiological situation.
